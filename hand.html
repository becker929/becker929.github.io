You can only play the cosmic hand you are dealt.

In the case of Ryne Alwik, he found himself on a small ship chasing the ghost of his ex wife through the charted seas of another planet. He stood no chance when the siren, impersonating her, crashed her boat in exactly the same way as she had, ten years ago, convincing him, in his agony, to capsize his own ship and meet her wetly in the dark sea, where he only came to his senses as she opened her sharp mouth. "End it quickly, please" were his last words before she plunged him under the waves, dragging him to her world beneath the stormy surface. 

<br/><br/>
He had been led so by Yrkle, a woman of the planet who was descended from the wood eaters, generally the first folks met by visitors from earth, who teach them the ways of eating wood crackers soaked in sap, and who allowed the Americans to convince them to fry the things. 

<br/><br/>
Here I must note that the largely Chinese class I attended on this planet was quite hospitable. The girl who sat next to me told me I looked nice, which I did because I'd dressed in my church clothes. My test score was high enough that I didn't need to leave the classroom like the other fellow who was trying to be a good example for the two young brothers from a bad neighborhood, who didn't really need his help as they knew the material already and had spent the previous night entertaining girls at a dance-and-bath party. 

<br/><br/>
Yrkle had manipulated Ryne to meet his fate on the sea due to a disagreement involving Ryne's capacity for acting rather like a pirate and chasing Yrkle's friends around the seas of this planet. 

<br/><br/>
When he came to in a damp, dark hole with walls of smooth stone, he panicked. Then the sea girl bit him in the neck again and he fell back asleep. This continued for a few nights, not very long at all, until one night he didn't panic when he awoke. At this point he found himself led out from the dungeon bedroom and into a lit hall where he was forced into a rather fine robe before finding himself pulled by the arm by his captor to the end of the hallway, which he didn't have time or mind to inspect, but which was also of stone, mainly, with some trim of polished driftwood. He emerged then into a hall full of people seated or standing around a dozen tables. This nearly made him panic again, until the scene came further into focus and the damned civility of the situation struck him like a dose of Valium he had forgotten he'd taken. Beside that, he could now see the girl who had been raping him in his sleep for four nights, who now held him by an arm full of bite holes, and she was gorgeous.
